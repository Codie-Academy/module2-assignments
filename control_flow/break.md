**Quiz 1: Understanding the `break` Statement**

1. What is the primary purpose of the `break` statement in Swift?
   a) To exit a loop completely
   b) To skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next
   c) To print a message to the console

2. Which of the following statements is true regarding the `break` statement?
   a) It can only be used in `if` statements
   b) It can only be used in `for-in` and `while` loops
   c) It can be used in `for-in` loops, `while` loops, and switch statements

3. What is the effect of using `break` in a loop?
   a) It ends the loop completely and continues with the next line of code after the loop
   b) It immediately goes to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the remaining code in the current iteration

**Quiz 2: Practical Usage of `break`**

1. In a `for-in` loop that iterates through an array of numbers, you encounter a number that meets a specific condition, 
   and you want to stop the loop entirely. What statement do you use?

2. How does the use of `break` differ from the use of `continue` in a loop?
   a) `break` ends the loop, while `continue` skips the current iteration
   b) `break` skips the current iteration and moves to the next, while `continue` ends the loop

**Exercise 1: Finding a Specific Value**

Write a Swift program that takes an array of integers as input and uses a `for-in` loop to search for a specific number. 
If the number is found in the array, use the `break` statement to exit the loop and print a message indicating that the number was found. 
If the number is not found, print a message indicating that it was not found.

**Exercise 2: Sum of Even Numbers**

Create a Swift program that uses a `for-in` loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 20. Calculate the sum of all even numbers in this range. 
Use the `break` statement to stop adding numbers once the sum reaches a value greater than or equal to 30. Print the final sum.
