**Quiz 1: Basics of `for-in` Loops**

1. What is the primary purpose of a `for-in` loop in programming?

   a) To define a function.
   b) To conditionally execute a block of code.
   c) To iterate over a collection of items.

2. In Swift, what does the `in` keyword indicate in a `for-in` loop?
3. Which of the following data structures can be iterated through using a `for-in` loop?

   a) Arrays
   b) Dictionaries
   c) Both arrays and dictionaries

4. Write a Swift `for-in` loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 5.

**Quiz 2: Iterating Over Arrays**

1. How can you access individual elements of an array in a `for-in` loop?
2. Write a Swift `for-in` loop that iterates over an array of names and prints each name.
3. What is the purpose of the `enumerated()` method when iterating over an array?
4. Modify your previous `for-in` loop to print both the index and name of each element in the array.

**Exercise 1: Sum of Numbers**

Write a Swift program that calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 10 using a `for-in` loop. 
You should initialize a variable to store the sum and update it within the loop.

**Exercise 2: Finding the Maximum**

Write a Swift program that finds and prints the maximum value in an array of integers. Use a `for-in` loop to iterate through the 
array and keep track of the maximum value found so far.

**Exercise 3: Reversing a String**

Write a Swift program that takes a string as input and uses a `for-in` loop to print the characters of the string in reverse order. 
For example, if the input is "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Exercise 4: FizzBuzz**

Write a Swift program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

These quizzes and exercises should help learners practice and reinforce their understanding of the `for-in` loop in Swift, 
which is commonly used for iterating over collections such as arrays and dictionaries.
