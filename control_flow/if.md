**Quiz 1: Basic `if` Statements**

1. What is the purpose of the `if` statement in programming?

   a) To repeat a block of code a specified number of times.
   
   b) To define a function.
   
   c) To conditionally execute a block of code.

2. In Swift, how do you denote the beginning and end of an `if` statement block?

3. Which keyword is used to specify the condition to be evaluated in an `if` statement?

4. What is the role of the `else` clause in an `if-else` statement?

5. Write a Swift `if` statement that checks if a variable `temperature` is greater than 30, and if it is, prints "It's hot outside."

**Quiz 2: `if-else` Statements**

1. What is the key difference between an `if` statement and an `if-else` statement?

2. When does the code inside the `else` block of an `if-else` statement execute?

3. Write a Swift `if-else` statement that checks if a number `x` is even, and if it is, prints "x is even," otherwise, prints "x is odd."

**Exercise 1: Age Verification**

Write a Swift program that asks the user to enter their age. Using an `if` statement, check if the entered age is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, print "You are eligible to vote." 
If it's less than 18, print "You are not eligible to vote."

**Exercise 2: Grade Calculator**

Write a Swift program that asks the user to enter their score as a percentage (0-100). Using an `if-else` statement, determine and print the corresponding letter grade based on the 
following scale:

- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: 0-59

**Exercise 3: Number Comparison**

Write a Swift program that prompts the user to enter two numbers. Using `if` statements, compare the two numbers and print the following messages:
- "Number 1 is greater" if the first number is greater.
- "Number 2 is greater" if the second number is greater.
- "Both numbers are equal" if they are equal.

**Exercise 4: Leap Year Checker**

Write a Swift program that asks the user to input a year. Use conditional statements to determine if the year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, except for years that are 
divisible by 100 but not by 400. Print "Leap year" or "Not a leap year" accordingly.

These quizzes and exercises should provide a good starting point for learners to practice and solidify their understanding of `if` statements and conditional logic in Swift.
