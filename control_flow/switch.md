**Quiz 1: Understanding the Switch Statement**

1. What is the primary purpose of the switch statement in Swift?

   a) To declare variables
   b) To define functions
   c) To control program flow based on the value of an expression

2. In a switch statement, what is the term used to describe the value or expression that is being tested for multiple possible cases?
3. What happens if none of the cases in a switch statement match the value of the tested expression, and there is no `default` case?
   a) The program crashes with an error
   b) The switch statement is ignored
   c) It continues to the code after the switch statement

**Quiz 2: Switch Cases**

1. In Swift, can a switch case contain multiple values or conditions?
   a) Yes
   b) No

2. What is the purpose of the `fallthrough` keyword in a switch case?
3. Which of the following is a valid case label in a switch statement?
   a) `case "apple", "banana":`
   b) `case 1...5:`

**Quiz 3: Switch Statements in Practice**

1. Write a Swift switch statement that takes a variable `grade` of type `Int` and prints a message based on the following conditions:
   - If `grade` is 90 or above, print "A"
   - If `grade` is 80 to 89, print "B"
   - If `grade` is 70 to 79, print "C"
   - If `grade` is below 70, print "F"

2. In a switch statement, when is it required to use the `break` statement?

**Exercise 1: FizzBuzz**

Write a Swift program that uses a switch statement to implement the classic FizzBuzz problem. 
The program should print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz," for multiples of 5, print "Buzz," and for multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

**Exercise 2: Day of the Week**

Create a Swift program that asks the user to enter a number between 1 and 7, representing a day of the week. 
Use a switch statement to print the corresponding day's name (e.g., 1 for "Monday," 2 for "Tuesday," etc.). If the user enters a number outside the valid range, print an error message.

**Exercise 3: Temperature Converter**

Write a Swift program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Ask the user to enter a temperature value and a 
unit (either "C" for Celsius or "F" for Fahrenheit). Use a switch statement to perform the conversion and print the result. 
For example, if the user enters "32 F," the program should convert it to Celsius and print the equivalent temperature.

These quizzes and exercises will help learners practice and solidify their understanding of the switch statement in Swift,
which is a powerful tool for controlling program flow based on the value of expressions.
