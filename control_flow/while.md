**Quiz 1: Understanding `while` and `repeat-while`**

1. What are `while` and `repeat-while` statements used for in programming?

   a) Defining functions
   b) Conditional execution of code
   c) Printing messages to the console

2. What is the key difference between a `while` loop and a `repeat-while` loop in Swift?

3. When is the condition in a `while` loop checked?

   a) Before the loop starts executing
   b) After the loop completes its first iteration
   c) During each iteration

4. How does a `repeat-while` loop differ from a `while` loop?

**Quiz 2: Basic `while` Loop**

1. Write a simple `while` loop in Swift that prints numbers from 1 to 5.
2. What would happen if you forget to include code to change the loop's control variable in a `while` loop?
3. Explain when you might choose to use a `while` loop over a `for-in` loop.

**Quiz 3: `repeat-while` Loop**

1. Write a Swift program that uses a `repeat-while` loop to ask the user for their age until they enter an age greater than or equal to 18. 
   Print a message indicating they are an adult.

2. In a `repeat-while` loop, when is the condition checked?

   a) Before the first iteration
   b) After each iteration
   c) Before each iteration

**Exercise 1: Number Guessing Game**

Create a number guessing game in Swift using a `repeat-while` loop. The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100 and ask 
the user to guess the number. Provide feedback (e.g., "Too high" or "Too low") based on the user's input and continue until the user guesses 
the correct number. Count the number of attempts and print it when they guess correctly.

**Exercise 2: Password Validation**

Write a Swift program that uses a `repeat-while` loop to repeatedly ask the user to enter a password. The program should keep asking until 
the user enters the correct password "password123." Print a success message when the correct password is entered.
