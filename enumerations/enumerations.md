**Quiz 1: Basic Concepts**

1. What is an enumeration (enum) in Swift?

   a. A collection of related values.
   b. A predefined function.
   c. A type of loop.

2. In Swift, which keyword is used to define an enumeration?

   a. `enum`
   b. `let`
   c. `struct`

**Exercise 1: Creating an Enumeration**

Define an enumeration named "Day" to represent the days of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.). Create cases for each day and assign raw values using integers (e.g., Monday is 1, Tuesday is 2, etc.).

**Quiz 2: Associated Values**

3. What are associated values in Swift enums used for?

   a. To store multiple cases in a single enum.
   b. To associate additional data with each enum case.
   c. To make the enum more readable.

4. In which scenario would you commonly use associated values in an enum?

   a. Representing simple options like on/off.
   b. Modeling complex data with varying attributes.
   c. Defining numeric values.

**Exercise 2: Enum with Associated Values**

Define an enumeration named "Weather" to represent various weather conditions, such as "Sunny," "Rainy," and "Cloudy." Add associated values to represent temperature (in degrees Celsius) for each weather condition. For example, "Sunny" can have an associated value of 28, "Rainy" can have an associated value of 15, and so on.

**Quiz 3: Raw Values**

5. What are raw values in Swift enums used for?

   a. To associate data with enum cases.
   b. To provide a default value for enum cases.
   c. To assign predefined values to enum cases.

6. How do you access the raw value of an enum case in Swift?

   a. By calling a function on the enum.
   b. By using a property with the case name.
   c. Raw values are not accessible.

**Exercise 3: Enum with Raw Values**

Define an enumeration named "Month" to represent the months of the year. Use raw values to assign a short abbreviation to each month (e.g., "Jan" for January, "Feb" for February, etc.).

**Quiz 4: Methods and Properties**

7. In Swift, can you define methods and properties inside an enum?

   a. Yes, you can define both methods and properties.
   b. No, methods and properties are not allowed in enums.
   c. You can define properties but not methods.

8. Which Swift keyword is used to define methods and properties in an enum?

   a. `func` and `var`
   b. `enum` and `case`
   c. `extension` and `init`

**Exercise 4: Enum with Methods and Properties**

Define an enumeration named "Coin" to represent different types of coins (e.g., Penny, Nickel, Dime, Quarter). Include methods for calculating the total value of a certain number of each coin type and properties for their respective values. For example, the "Dime" case should have a value of 10 cents and a method to calculate the total value of a given number of dimes.

These quizzes and exercises should help you practice and reinforce your understanding of enumerations (enums) in Swift. Enums are a versatile feature that allows you to create structured, type-safe representations of data, and mastering them is essential for effective Swift programming.
