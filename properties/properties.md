**Quiz 1: Basic Concepts of Properties**

1. What are properties in Swift, and why are they important in object-oriented programming?
2. Differentiate between stored properties and computed properties in Swift. Provide examples of each.
3. Describe the purpose of lazy properties in Swift. Provide a scenario where using a lazy property is beneficial.

**Exercise 1: Stored Properties**

Create a Swift structure called `Rectangle` to represent a rectangle. Add two stored properties, `width` and `height`, of type `Double`. Implement an initializer that allows you to create instances of `Rectangle` with the specified width and height.

**Exercise 2: Computed Properties**

Enhance the `Rectangle` structure by adding a computed property called `area` that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle (i.e., `width * height`). Ensure that the `area` property has a getter method.
